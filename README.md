# Password Generator

This repository houses a robust and adaptable password generator implemented in multiple programming languages. Below, each version is thoroughly explained, focusing on three password types: with symbols, without symbols, and with only numbers.

## Python

### Overview
The Python version mirrors the Java implementation with an object-oriented design. The `PasswordGenerator` class supports both default and parameterized constructors, emphasizing an easy-to-use structure.

### Methods
- **generatePasswordWithSymbols():** Generates a password with symbols, characters, uppercase letters, digits, and shuffled for enhanced security.
- **generatePasswordWithoutSymbols():** Creates a password without symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly():** Generates a password with exactly 6 digits.

### Demonstration
Usage examples are provided in the `__main__` block.

## JavaScript

### Overview
The JavaScript implementation follows an object-oriented design using the `PasswordGenerator` class, utilizing the `Math.random()` function for randomness.

### Methods
- **generatePasswordWithSymbols():** Generates a password with symbols, characters, uppercase letters, digits, and shuffled for enhanced security.
- **generatePasswordWithoutSymbols():** Creates a password without symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly():** Generates a password with exactly 6 digits.

### Demonstration
Examples of usage are included in the main code block.

## Ruby

### Overview
The Ruby version adopts an object-oriented structure with the `PasswordGenerator` class, providing customizable counts for password generation.

### Methods
- **generatePasswordWithSymbols():** Generates a password with symbols, characters, uppercase letters, digits, and shuffled for enhanced security.
- **generatePasswordWithoutSymbols():** Creates a password without symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly():** Generates a password with exactly 6 digits.

### Demonstration
Usage examples highlight the simplicity and flexibility of the Ruby code.

## PHP

### Overview
The PHP implementation maintains an object-oriented design inspired by Java. The `PasswordGenerator` class allows users to set counts for different password components.

### Methods
- **generatePasswordWithSymbols():** Generates a password with symbols, characters, uppercase letters, digits, and shuffled for enhanced security.
- **generatePasswordWithoutSymbols():** Creates a password without symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly():** Generates a password with exactly 6 digits.

### Demonstration
Usage examples showcase the generation of passwords in different scenarios.

## C

### Overview
The C version employs imperative programming with the `PasswordGenerator` struct, following a procedural style for password generation.

### Functions
- **createPasswordGeneratorWithSymbols():** Creates a `PasswordGenerator` struct with specified counts for symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithoutSymbols():** Generates a password without symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly():** Generates a password with exactly 6 digits.

### Demonstration
Usage examples demonstrate the straightforward approach to password generation.

## C++

### Overview
The C++ version adopts an object-oriented approach with the `PasswordGenerator` class and utilizes the `<random>` header for secure randomness.

### Methods
- **generatePasswordWithSymbols():** Generates a password with symbols, characters, uppercase letters, digits, and shuffled for enhanced security.
- **generatePasswordWithoutSymbols():** Creates a password without symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly():** Generates a password with exactly 6 digits.

### Demonstration
Examples in the main code block illustrate the simplicity and effectiveness of the C++ implementation.

## Java

### Overview
The Java implementation revolves around the `PasswordGenerator` class, offering default and parameterized constructors for versatility. Passwords can be generated with symbols, without symbols, or with only numbers. The generation process includes characters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols, with shuffling for increased randomness. Secure randomness is achieved through the `SecureRandom` class.

### Constructors
- **Default Constructor:** Sets default counts for characters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols.
- **Parameterized Constructor:** Allows users to specify counts during object creation.

### Methods
- **generatePasswordWithSymbols():** Generates a password with symbols, characters, uppercase letters, digits, and shuffled for enhanced security.
- **generatePasswordWithoutSymbols():** Creates a password without symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly():** Generates a password with exactly 6 digits.

### Demonstration
The `main` method showcases the generator's functionality across various scenarios.

## Golang

### Overview
The Golang version embraces functional programming with the `PasswordGenerator` struct and uses the `math/rand` package for randomness.

### Functions
- **createPasswordGeneratorWithSymbols():** Creates a `PasswordGenerator` struct with specified counts for symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithoutSymbols():** Generates a password without symbols.
- **generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly():** Generates a password with exactly 6 digits.

### Demonstration
Examples in the main code block showcase the functional programming style in Golang.
