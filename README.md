# Password Generator

This repository contains a versatile password generator implemented in various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, Java, and Golang. Below are detailed explanations for each version:

## Python
The Python version of the password generator mirrors the Java implementation, offering a versatile and secure solution. The `PasswordGenerator` class supports both default and parameterized constructors, allowing users to define character, uppercase letter, digit, and symbol counts. The password is generated by combining random selections from different character sets and is then shuffled for added randomness. Methods like `generatePasswordWithoutSymbols()` and `generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly()` provide additional customization options. The code emphasizes an object-oriented approach and demonstrates usage in the `__main__` block.

## JavaScript
The JavaScript password generator replicates the Java functionality, featuring an object-oriented design. The `PasswordGenerator` class includes methods for generating passwords, both with and without symbols, as well as with numbers only. The implementation utilizes the `Math.random()` function for randomness and is showcased with examples in the main code block.

## Ruby
The Ruby implementation of the password generator follows an object-oriented structure, similar to Java and Python. The `PasswordGenerator` class, with customizable counts, creates secure passwords with characters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. Examples of password generation are provided, emphasizing the simplicity and flexibility of the Ruby code.

## PHP
In PHP, the password generator adopts an object-oriented design, resembling the original Java code. The `PasswordGenerator` class allows users to set counts for characters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. It utilizes the `rand()` function for randomness and includes examples demonstrating the generation of passwords for different scenarios.

## C
The C implementation of the password generator uses imperative programming and follows a procedural style. The `PasswordGenerator` struct, created with the `createPasswordGenerator` function, generates passwords with specified counts for characters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. The `generatePassword` function showcases the password generation process, emphasizing a straightforward and functional approach.

## C++
The C++ version of the password generator adopts an object-oriented approach with the `PasswordGenerator` class. It utilizes the `<random>` header for secure randomness and includes methods for generating passwords with customizable counts. Examples in the main code block showcase the simplicity and effectiveness of the C++ implementation.

## Java
The Java implementation of the password generator provides a secure and customizable solution for creating passwords. The `PasswordGenerator` class, with both default and parameterized constructors, allows users to specify counts for characters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. The password is generated using a combination of these elements, and the result is shuffled for enhanced randomness. The `generatePasswordWithoutSymbols()` method generates passwords without symbols, while `generatePasswordWithNumbersOnly()` creates passwords with exactly 6 digits. The code employs the `SecureRandom` class for secure randomness and includes a demonstration in the `main` method to showcase various password generation scenarios.

## Golang
The Golang implementation of the password generator embraces functional programming. The `PasswordGenerator` struct, created with the `NewPasswordGenerator` function, generates passwords with specified counts for characters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols. The code uses the `math/rand` package for randomness and is demonstrated with examples in the main code block.
